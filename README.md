# Spiral_Dojo
Repository for a spiral (2D) array dojo.

# Description

Classic definition: A spiral is a curve which emanates from a central point, getting progressively farther away as it revolves around the point.

Your objective is to complete a function createSpiral(N) that receives an integer N and returns two-dimensional array where numbers from 1 to N should be represented as clockwise spiral.

Return an empty array if N < 1

- Example:

  N = 3 Output: [[1,2,3],[8,9,4],[7,6,5]]

  1    2    3    
  8    9    4    
  7    6    5
